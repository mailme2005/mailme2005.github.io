  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> September 1, 2025</p>

  <p>Tripzy (“we,” “our,” or “us”) values your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, share, and protect your information when you use the Tripzy mobile application (“App”).</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Personal Information:</strong> Such as your email address, if you voluntarily contact our support team.</li>
    <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> Anonymous information about how the App is used (e.g., trip counts, feature usage) to help us improve performance and features.</li>
    <li><strong>Third-Party Data:</strong> We use third-party APIs (e.g., Google Places API) to provide location-based travel results. These services may collect limited data in accordance with their own privacy policies.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide, maintain, and improve Tripzy’s features and services.</li>
    <li>Personalize trip planning results and recommendations.</li>
    <li>Respond to customer support requests.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>We do not sell, rent, or trade your personal information. Limited data may be shared with third-party service providers only as necessary to power app features (e.g., retrieving location data from Google Places). All third-party services are bound by their own privacy policies.</p>

  <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
  <p>We implement commercially reasonable technical and organizational safeguards to protect your information. However, no security system is completely impenetrable, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

  <h2>5. User Rights</h2>
  <p>Depending on your location, you may have rights to access, correct, or delete your personal information. To exercise these rights, please contact us at the email provided below.</p>

  <h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated “Effective Date.”</p>

  <h2>7. Contact Us</h2>
  <p>If you have questions about this Privacy Policy or how your information is handled, please contact us:</p>
